//! Universal `Request → Vec<PositionalLineageHash>` contract for KV cache identity.
//!
//! See `README.md` for the design rationale (the three-representation problem, why PLH
//! wins, the multimodal gap, and the extension-vs-PLH-alone caveat). This crate is the
//! single contract that the router, consolidator, kvbm, and framework workers should
//! converge on for block hashing.
//!
//! # Pure-computation contract
//!
//! This crate is intentionally a library, not a service. It contains no async, no
//! transports, no traits over runtime/scheduler config, and no event types. Those
//! belong in higher layers (kvbm-connector, consolidator, kv-router).
