//! TCP Transport Module
//!
//! TODO: this design-and-implementation overview should eventually move into
//! the architecture docs (`docs/design-docs/architecture.md`); kept here for
//! now until there's a home for transport-level design notes.
//!
//! Brief overview of the request-response transport:
//!
//! The request plane (TCP, NATS, etc.) carries a two-part message whose header is a
//! `RequestControlMessage` — embedding the [`ConnectionInfo`] that tells the worker where to call home
//! — and whose data half is the serialized request body if request streaming is not needed.
//! All subsequent streaming bytes (responses, and request-stream) flow over the TCP socket established afterwards.
//!
//! For simplicity, if request streaming is needed, the `RequestControlMessage` should not contain
//! the request body. Instead, all requests of the stream should be sent over the TCP socket.
//!
//! The TCP transport is the implementation that produces and consumes [`ConnectionInfo`] and
//! carries the streaming response (and, optionally, request-stream) bytes between two peers
//! on separate sockets from the initial request.
//!
//! # Roles
//!
//! The TCP transport has two sides:
//!
//! - Request sender: The upstream that **initiates the transfer** runs [`server::TcpStreamServer`],
//!   registers what it expects to receive, and listens. It publishes its address + a per-stream
//!   subject UUID via [`TcpStreamConnectionInfo`], which is serialized into a [`ConnectionInfo`].
//! - Request receiver: The downstream that **acknowledges the transfer** runs [`client::TcpClient`],
//!   reads the connection info out of the request, dials the listener, and identifies itself with
//!   a `CallHomeHandshake` to the request sender.
//!
//! Although TCP is bidirectional, we keep separate sockets for the request stream and the response
//! stream to match Dynamo's design principles. To establish both, the request receiver must receive
//! two [`ConnectionInfo`] objects and run two handshakes — each [`StreamType`] is its own TCP
//! connection with its own subject UUID.
//!
//! # Server-Client Interaction
//!
//! See the test cases below for detailed examples. Note that the response stream expects the client
//! to send a [`ResponseStreamPrologue`] in order to properly establish the stream.
//!
//! # Stream Types
//!
//! [`StreamType::Response`] — worker pushes engine output back to the upstream. Server side is
//! `process_response_stream` (delivers a [`StreamReceiver`] to the awaiting registrant once the
//! client has sent its [`ResponseStreamPrologue`]). Client side is
//! [`client::TcpClient::create_response_stream`] (returns a [`StreamSender`]; spawns reader/writer
//! tasks plus a connection monitor that waits for the server's FIN).
//!
//! [`StreamType::Request`] — upstream pushes the request body (or a stream of follow-up frames)
//! into a downstream worker. Server side is `process_request_stream` (delivers a [`StreamSender`]
//! immediately; there is no prologue today). Client side is
//! [`client::TcpClient::create_request_stream`] (returns a [`StreamReceiver`]; spawns a single
//! task that handles both directions on the socket).
//!
//! # Registration and Lifecycle
//!
//! [`ResponseService::register`] takes [`StreamOptions`] with `enable_request_stream` /
//! `enable_response_stream` flags and returns [`PendingConnections`] holding zero, one, or two
//! [`RegisteredStream`]s. Each [`RegisteredStream`] carries a [`ConnectionInfo`] and a oneshot
//! that resolves to the [`StreamSender`] / [`StreamReceiver`] once the downstream dials in and the
//! handshake completes. Once registered, the pending entry remains until the downstream successfully
//! establishes the stream. Two mechanisms ensure the pending entry is removed when the downstream
//! cannot be reached:
//!
//! 1. The returned [`RegisteredStream`] is RAII — dropping it without `into_parts()` removes the
//!    pending entry from the server's subject tables. This is typically used by the request sender
//!    up until the `RequestControlMessage` is sent and the stream is established.
//! 2. The server tracks `subject UUID → oneshot` in `tx_subjects` / `rx_subjects`.
//!    [`server::TcpStreamServer::associate_instance`] links one or both
//!    subjects to a discovery instance so [`server::TcpStreamServer::cancel_instance_streams`] can
//!    drop both halves' oneshots together when a worker disappears. Tombstones (`TOMBSTONE_TTL`)
//!    are the safety net that closes the cancel-vs-register race.
//!
//! # CallHome Handshake
//!
//! The first message a [`client::TcpClient`] sends on a freshly-opened socket is a
//! `CallHomeHandshake` header-only frame carrying `{ subject, stream_type }`. The server pops
//! the matching entry out of `tx_subjects` (for [`StreamType::Request`]) or `rx_subjects` (for
//! [`StreamType::Response`]) and resolves the registrant's oneshot. After that the socket carries
//! framed [`TwoPartCodec`] messages: data frames in the natural direction, control frames
//! (and, for response streams, the prologue) interleaved.
//!
//! # Control / Shutdown Protocol
//!
//! [`ControlMessage`] frames are header-only frames interleaved with data on either socket:
//!
//! - [`ControlMessage::Sentinel`] — per-direction clean end-of-stream; the producing side emits
//!   it before closing the socket. Used on both the request and response sockets.
//! - [`ControlMessage::Stop`] — sender asks the receiver to cancel; the receiving side calls
//!   `context.stop()`.
//! - [`ControlMessage::Kill`] — hard cancel; `context.kill()` and break out.
//!
//! `Stop` and `Kill` only flow from upstream to downstream (i.e. frontend → worker). This is an
//! expected asymmetry: the upstream can cancel the downstream operation for various reasons,
//! but the downstream cannot cancel the upstream operation. A downstream that cannot consume
//! the stream simply drops its socket, which the upstream surfaces as a write error and
//! interprets as a hint for recovery or failure propagation.
//!
//! The cancellation direction is fixed, but the two streams carry **data** in opposite
//! directions, so the practical handling differs per stream:
//!
//! ## Response stream (downstream → upstream) — bidirectional
//!
//! - Upstream writes: `Stop` / `Kill` (any time, to cancel).
//! - Downstream writes: data frames, then `Sentinel` on clean close (skipped on kill/stop).
//!
//! ## Request stream (upstream → downstream) — unidirectional after the handshake
//!
//! - Upstream writes: data frames, then exactly one closing frame — `Sentinel` (clean drain)
//!   / `Stop` (`context.stopped()`) / `Kill` (`context.killed()`).
//! - Downstream writes: nothing. Its TCP write half is closed right after the CallHome handshake.
