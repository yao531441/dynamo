"""
Utilities for building multimodal routing metadata from vLLM's mm_features.

Converts vLLM's EngineCoreRequest.mm_features (mm_hashes + mm_placeholders)
into the canonical pad_value routing scheme used by dynamo's KvRouter: image
positions in the routing token stream are replaced with pad_value(mm_hash), and
no block_mm_infos side channel is emitted. This matches the Rust frontend
(`gather_mm_exact_routing_info`) and the kv-router's vLLM-event normalization,
so request-side and event-side block hashes agree across backends.

    Extracts mm_hashes and placeholder ranges from MultiModalFeatureSpec
