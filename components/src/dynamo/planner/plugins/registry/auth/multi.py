"""``MultiSourceAuth`` — fan-out composition of AuthValidators.

Tries each configured source in order; the first to return an
``AuthIdentity`` wins. Short-circuit on first success — subsequent
sources are not consulted, which is critical when a later source would
incur network I/O (e.g. K8s TokenReview).

On total failure, raises ``AuthError`` with the *last* underlying
failure message. Callers (the RPC layer) log the chained message for
server-side audit but only surface ``reject_reason="auth_failed"`` to
the client.
