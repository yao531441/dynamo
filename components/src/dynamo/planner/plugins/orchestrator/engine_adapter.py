"""``OrchestratorEngineAdapter`` — production ``EngineProtocol`` adapter
for the plugin chain.

Wraps ``LocalPlannerOrchestrator`` behind the same ``initial_tick`` /
``tick`` / ``shutdown`` interface that the legacy ``_PSMEngineAdapter``
exposes. ``NativePlannerBase`` selects between the two via
``PlannerConfig.scheduling.use_orchestrator``.

Architecture invariant: PipelineContext is the only input channel
--------------------------------------------------------------------
All plugins — both in-process builtins (follow-up PR) and external
gRPC plugins — receive their per-tick inputs through
``PipelineContext.observations`` exclusively. There is **no**
``prime_tick(...)`` side-channel, ``self._last_fpm``-style stash,
or any other path that delivers observation data to a plugin instance
outside of the stage RPC.

This invariant ensures:
  * Plugin API is uniform across in-process and over-wire transports.
  * Adding a new observation field requires touching one schema
    (``ObservationData``), not two delivery paths.
  * Builtin plugins (follow-up PR) and external plugins receive
    byte-identical input, so dual-path parity tests are meaningful.

Internal responsibilities
-------------------------

1. **Tick lifecycle cadence tracking**:
   Owns ``_next_load_s`` / ``_next_throughput_s`` state and advances
   them at tick boundaries the same way
   ``PlannerStateMachine._next_scheduled_tick`` does, so the
   ``next_tick`` field in ``PlannerEffects`` matches PSM's legacy
   path bit-for-bit.
2. **TickInput → PipelineContext bridge**:
   Extracts ``traffic`` into ``TrafficMetrics``, ``worker_counts``
   (counts + scaling-in-progress flags) into ``WorkerState``, and
   per-engine FPM observations into ``FpmData`` (msgspec/msgpack-
   encoded, keyed by ``"<worker_id>/<dp_rank>"``) on ``ObservationData``.
   External plugins declaring ``needs=["observations.fpm"]`` receive
   the FPM map; an empty/absent submap means "no FPM this tick".
3. **FPM regression observation**:
   Before the orchestrator tick, feeds FPM into the orchestrator-owned
   regression models (mirrors PSM's ``_observe_fpm``). This is a
   planner-internal regression-fit path, distinct from delivering FPM
   to plugins.
4. **PipelineOutcome → PlannerEffects projection**:
   Reads the orchestrator's ``final_proposal.targets``, detects "no
   change" against ``worker_counts``, and projects to
   ``PlannerEffects.scale_to``. ``diagnostics`` is empty — numeric
   fields moved to Prometheus.

Bootstrap API
-------------

``install_regressions`` + ``bootstrap_plugins`` mirror
``LocalPlannerOrchestrator``'s equivalents but are exposed on the
adapter so callers (mode subclasses) have a single entry point.
