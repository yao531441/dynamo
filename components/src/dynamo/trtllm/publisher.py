TensorRT-LLM KV Event Publisher Module

This module contains the Publisher class that retrieves KV cache events from TensorRT-LLM
and publishes them either to ZMQ (for consolidator) or NATS (direct to router).

Key Components:
- ZmqKvEventPublisher: Pure Python ZMQ PUBLISHER that publishes TensorRT-LLM KV events
  to ZMQ (so the consolidator can subscribe). This is different from KvEventPublisher
  in dynamo.llm, which is a Rust-based class that can optionally subscribe from a ZMQ
  source and publishes to NATS.
- Publisher: Main class that coordinates event publishing (ZMQ or NATS) and metrics publishing.

Event Flow:
- With Consolidator: Engine → ZmqKvEventPublisher (ZMQ PUB) → Consolidator → KvEventPublisher (dynamo.llm, ZMQ SUB) → NATS → Router
- Without Consolidator: Engine → KvEventPublisher (NATS PUB) → Router
