# Multi-worker aggregated embedding serving.
#
# Spawns 1 frontend + 2 embedding workers, each on its own GPU and its own
# DYN_SYSTEM_PORT so per-worker metrics can be scraped independently.
#
# Used by the multi-worker embedding tests to verify:
#   1. Same-model load balancing — pass the same MODEL twice; the frontend
#      should weighted-randomly distribute requests across both workers.
#   2. Multi-model dispatch       — pass two different MODELs; the
#      name-keyed router (lib/llm/src/discovery/model_manager.rs) should
#      send each request only to the worker registered for that model.
#
# GPUs: 2
#
# Usage:
#   agg_embed_multiworker.sh MODEL1 MODEL2 [EXTRA_DYNAMO_VLLM_ARGS...]
#
# EXTRA args (after the two model positions) are forwarded verbatim to
# *both* dynamo.vllm worker processes. The current launch matches the
# single-worker ``agg_embed.sh`` script (``--runner pooling``,
# ``--dtype float32``, MEAN pooler config, ``--max-model-len 2048``,
# ``--no-enable-prefix-caching``).

# Each worker registers under its OWN Dynamo NAMESPACE.
#
# Why namespaces and not just unique components or endpoints: the frontend
# keys ``Model.worker_sets`` by ``(namespace, model_type)`` (see
# ``worker_set_key`` in ``lib/llm/src/discovery/watcher.rs``), and
# ``add_worker_set`` is an insert-overwrite on that key. Two workers
# sharing a namespace -- regardless of how their endpoint paths differ --
# both hash to the same ``ws_key``, and the second registration silently
# replaces the first ``WorkerSet`` (along with its push_router). Only the
# last-registered worker survives in the routing table; the other one
# stays alive but is orphaned from the frontend's
# ``select_worker_set_with`` selector. The original "one model per
# endpoint" symptom was a sibling consequence of the same collision --
# this resolves both by giving each worker its own namespace, so both
# ``WorkerSet``s coexist and ``select_worker_set_with`` does its
# weighted-random fan-out as designed.
#
# Endpoint format is ``namespace.component.endpoint`` (dots, not slashes).
