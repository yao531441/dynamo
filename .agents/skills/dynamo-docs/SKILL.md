description: Add, update, move, or remove content on the Dynamo Fern docs site — standard docs pages, catalog-driven recipe and feature-benchmark pages, examples, recipes, and translations — keeping everything in line with the documentation style guide. Use for any change under docs/, recipes/, or examples/ (new page, edit, section move, rename, removal, recipe/benchmark page, .zh-CN translation, version cut) and whenever content needs its frontmatter, headings, links, callouts, or terminology fixed.

Unified skill for adding, updating, moving, and removing content on the Dynamo Fern documentation
site, in line with the project's authoring guides.

Two authoring guides govern this work; read whichever applies before writing:

- [`docs/documentation-style-guide.md`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/docs/documentation-style-guide.md) — the standard for **every** page: frontmatter, headings, prose, terminology, links, callouts. The must-fix subset is distilled in [Style Guide Is the Standard](#style-guide-is-the-standard) and [Content Rules](#content-rules) below.
- [`docs/recipes/_catalog/README.md`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/docs/recipes/_catalog/README.md) — the standard for **recipe and feature-benchmark pages** (the catalog contract, the `.mdx` page blueprint, and the pure-CSS target picker). See [Add a Recipe or Feature Benchmark Page](#add-a-recipe-or-feature-benchmark-page).

## Branch Rule

**ALL edits happen on `main` (or a feature branch based on `main`).**
The `docs-website` branch is CI-managed and must **never** be edited by hand.

## Style Guide Is the Standard

Every page under `docs/` (and the READMEs under `examples/` and `recipes/`) follows the
[Documentation Style Guide](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/docs/documentation-style-guide.md)
(`docs/documentation-style-guide.md`). Read it before writing content. The docs bot enforces a
**must-fix** subset on every PR — get these right or the checks fail:

- **SPDX header** on every file, copyright range `2025-2026`. Fern pages put the two `#` lines
  *inside* the `---` frontmatter; plain READMEs use an HTML-comment block.
- **Frontmatter with at least one metadata key** (`title`/`subtitle`/`sidebar-title`) and **no body
  `# H1`**. Fern renders the page H1 from the nav `page:` value, so a body `# H1` produces a
  duplicate title — and a bare `#` SPDX line left in the body also renders as an H1. Start the body
  at `##`.
- **A nav entry** in `docs/index.yml` for every new page — a page not in the nav is unreachable.
- **Links**: relative path *with extension* within `docs/` (`[Routing](router-concepts.md)`);
  absolute `https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/<path>` URL for targets outside `docs/`
  (examples, recipes, source; `/tree/main/` for a directory). No `../` path that escapes `docs/`, and
  never a hardcoded `https://docs.nvidia.com/...` link to a page in this repo. Link text names the
  destination, never "click here".
- **No internal or sensitive references**: NVBug/JIRA/Linear IDs, internal hostnames, secrets,
  `TODO`/`FIXME`.

Everything else in the style guide (page types, heading case, terminology, list and code-fence
formatting, the pre-merge checklist) is guidance — the high-value rules are distilled in
[Content Rules](#content-rules) below; apply them and deviate only with a reason.

## Content Rules

Apply these on every page so the result reads like a person wrote it and passes review without a
round-trip to the style guide. These are defaults; deviate with a reason.

- **Page type (Diátaxis).** Each page serves one need — *tutorial* (`getting-started/`), *how-to*
  (`backends/<engine>/`, `kubernetes/`), *reference* (flags/APIs/config), or *explanation*
  (`design-docs/`). Don't blend a how-to into a flag reference; split and cross-link.
- **Headings.** Title Case for short label / noun-phrase headings ("Routing Behavior"); sentence
  case for full-phrase headings ("Choosing a checkpoint flow"). Be consistent within a page. No end
  punctuation. Logical `##` → `###` hierarchy, no skipped levels. Renaming a heading breaks inbound
  `#anchor` links — rename deliberately.
- **Terminology, exact casing.** Backends: **vLLM**, **SGLang**, **TensorRT-LLM** (or **TRT-LLM**) —
  never "vllm", "Sglang", "TensorRT LLM". **NVIDIA Dynamo** on first mention, then **Dynamo**; **KV
  router**, **NIXL**, **GPU**; **Kubernetes**, not "k8s", in prose. Expand acronyms on first use
  ("Time To First Token (TTFT)"). Use one word per concept.
- **Inclusive terms.** "denylist"/"allowlist", not "blacklist"/"whitelist"; "primary"/"replica", not
  "master"/"slave".
- **Cut marketing and bombast.** Remove "seamless, robust, powerful, blazing-fast, cutting-edge,
  effortless, unlock, leverage, delve, comprehensive, rich ecosystem, world-class, game-changing".
  Cut filler ("it's important to note", "simply", "just", "in order to") and difficulty words
  ("easy", "easily"). Start sentences with a verb; active voice; present tense; second-person
  imperative. Name the flag/default/command, not "configure the appropriate settings". Avoid the
  em-dash-aside tic.
- **Procedures.** Condition before instruction ("To enable KV-aware routing, set `--router-mode
  kv`", not the reverse). One action per numbered step.
- **Links.** Follow the must-fix Links rule in
  [Style Guide Is the Standard](#style-guide-is-the-standard) (relative + extension inside `docs/`,
  absolute GitHub URL outside, no `../` escape, no `docs.nvidia.com` self-link).
- **Code fences** always tag a language (`bash`, not `sh`); no `$`/`#` prompt prefixes; put output in
  its own `text` block. Wrap flags, paths, and `DYN_*` env vars in backticks in prose.
- **Lifecycle.** Mark preview features **Experimental.** and legacy ones **Deprecated.** (with a
  `> [!WARNING]`); note availability for new features ("Available since v0.X").

## Operations

Pick your operation:

- Standard `.md` doc page → [Add a Page](#add-a-page)
- Rendered recipe / feature-benchmark page (`.mdx` + catalog triple) → [Add a Recipe or Feature Benchmark Page](#add-a-recipe-or-feature-benchmark-page)
- Code under `examples/` or `recipes/` → [Add an Example or Recipe (code)](#add-an-example-or-recipe-code)
- Edit, move, or remove existing content → [Update a Page](#update-a-page), [Remove a Page](#remove-a-page) (recipes: [Move, defer, or remove a recipe](#move-defer-or-remove-a-recipe))
- Chinese translation or version cut → [Translations and Versioned Navs](#translations-and-versioned-navs)

### Add a Page

1. **Choose placement from the live nav.** Open `docs/index.yml` and find the existing page closest
   in topic to yours — your page joins **that** section, and its file goes in that sibling's
   subdirectory under `docs/`. Page *type* narrows the field (tutorial → `getting-started/`, how-to →
   `backends/<engine>/` or `kubernetes/`, reference → flags/APIs/config, explanation →
   `design-docs/`), but the nearest existing page is the tie-breaker — don't guess from the section
   names in [Navigation](#navigation-tabs-and-sections), read the file. Note the section, the
   subdirectory, a kebab-case `.md` filename, and the page title.
2. Create `docs/<subdirectory>/<filename>.md`. Frontmatter carries the SPDX header plus at least one
   metadata key; the body starts at `##` with a short intro — **no body `# H1`**:

```markdown
---
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright (c) 2025-2026 NVIDIA CORPORATION & AFFILIATES. All rights reserved.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
title: <Page Title>
subtitle: <One-line description of the page>
---

Short intro paragraph stating what the page covers.

## <First section>
```

3. Add a nav entry in `docs/index.yml` under the section you chose in step 1 — a `- page:` in that
   section's `contents:`, 2-space indent, `path:` relative to `docs/` (see
   [Navigation](#navigation-tabs-and-sections) for the grammar):

```yaml
- page: <Page Title>
  path: <subdirectory>/<filename>.md
```

### Update a Page

1. Locate by file path, page title, or keyword search (`grep -rn` in `docs/`).
2. **Content only** -- edit the markdown file directly; keep it within the style guide.
3. **Title/label change** -- update the frontmatter (`title`/`sidebar-title`) and the `- page:` name
   in `docs/index.yml`.
4. **Section move** -- `git mv` the file when the subdirectory changes, move the nav entry to the new
   section, and update every incoming link.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A page's URL is `<section-slug>/<page-name-slug>`, where the page-name slug comes from the nav
> `page:` label. Moving a page to another section **or** renaming its label changes that URL. Add a
> **dev-scoped** redirect to the `redirects:` list in `fern/docs.yml`: `/dynamo/dev/<old>` →
> `/dynamo/dev/<new>`. Editing `docs/index.yml` regenerates only the `dev` nav, so do **not** redirect
> the unversioned (`/dynamo/<old>`) or `/dynamo/latest/<old>` forms — those serve **Latest**, a frozen
> release snapshot that `main` edits don't touch, and a redirect there would break a working URL. See
> [Redirects and the version model](#redirects-and-the-version-model).

### Remove a Page

1. Find incoming links: `grep -rn "<filename>" docs/`.
2. `git rm docs/<subdirectory>/<filename>.md`.
3. Remove the `- page:` block from `docs/index.yml`. If it was the last page in a section, remove the
   whole `- section:` block.
4. Fix or remove every incoming link found in step 1, and add a `fern/docs.yml` redirect if the page
   had a stable URL.

### Add a Recipe or Feature Benchmark Page

Recipe and feature-benchmark pages are **catalog-driven** and use `.mdx` (they embed a pure-CSS
target picker). Authoritative guide:
[`docs/recipes/_catalog/README.md`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/docs/recipes/_catalog/README.md).
Each page is a triple — page + catalog entry + nav:

1. **Write the `.mdx`** at `docs/recipes/<slug>.mdx` (or `docs/benchmarks/<slug>.mdx`). Frontmatter
   carries SPDX + `title` + one-sentence `subtitle`; body starts with a short intro, then the target
   picker — multi-target pages use the radio picker, single-target pages use the **static** form
   (exact classes under [Target picker](#target-picker) below) — then the fixed section order:
   `## Prerequisites` → `## Deploy` → `## Smoke Test` → `## Benchmark` → `## Expected Performance`
   (omit if no numbers) → `## Compare All Targets` (multi-target only) → `## Related Feature
   Benchmarks` → `## Notes` → `## Source`. **MDX rule:** blank line after `<div ...>` and before
   `</div>`; keep code fences at column 0.
2. **Add a catalog entry** — one file at `docs/recipes/_catalog/recipes/<id>.yaml` (or
   `docs/benchmarks/_catalog/benchmarks/<id>.yaml`), SPDX header, exactly one object. **Read the
   sibling `schema.json` first for the exact field set** (`docs/recipes/_catalog/schema.json` for
   recipes, `docs/benchmarks/_catalog/schema.json` for benchmarks — they are **different** schemas) —
   each is `additionalProperties: false`, so an invented or misspelled key fails validation; don't
   guess the shape. A **recipe** entry requires `id`,
   `title`, `provider`, `model`, `status`, `targets`, `maintainer`, and each `targets[]` item
   requires `id`, `recommended`, `hardware`, `runtime`, `topology`, `techniques`, `workload`,
   `deploy`, `expected_performance`. Internal `id:` **must equal the filename**; active entries carry
   `page:`, deferred ones carry `deferred_reason` and omit `page:`. Add the `<id>` to the matching
   `_catalog/index.yaml` (`recipes:` for active, `deferred_recipes:` for deferred — it controls
   sidebar/landing order).
3. **Wire navigation** in `docs/index.yml`: a `- page:` under `- tab: recipes` for recipes, or under
   the **Feature Benchmarks** section (`- tab: docs`) for benchmarks. Per-benchmark pages are usually
   `hidden: true` (surfaced from the landing page).
4. **Patch `fern/main.css` only if** the page introduces a picker axis value not already supported
   (`recipe-sku`: `b200`/`h200`/`h100`/`gb200`/`hopper`/`blackwell`; `recipe-usecase`:
   `chat`/`agentic`; `recipe-variant`: `agg`/`disagg`/…). A value missing from CSS renders but
   filters nothing.
5. **Add the landing card** in `docs/recipes/README.mdx` and update the model/target counts.
6. **Validate**: `python3 docs/recipes/_catalog/validate.py` (covers both catalogs), then `fern
   check` and `fern docs broken-links`.

#### Catalog entry shape

`schema.json` is authoritative for the field set; this skeleton just anchors the **nested shapes and
enums** that are easy to get wrong (`model`/`hardware`/`runtime`/`workload`/`deploy`/
`expected_performance` are **objects**, not scalars; `status` and `topology` are **enums**). Minimal
valid active entry:

```yaml
id: llama-3-1-8b                  # == filename; pattern ^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$
title: Llama 3.1 8B
provider: meta                    # landing-page filter key (meta, qwen, nvidia, …)
model:
  name: Llama 3.1 8B
  hf_id: Meta-Llama/Llama-3.1-8B
  precision: BF16
status: validated                 # enum: validated | experimental  (NOT "active")
page: recipes/llama-3-1-8b.mdx    # active only; deferred → omit page:, add deferred_reason:
maintainer: Jane Doe              # or null (null is tracked as a gap)
targets:                          # >= 1 item
  - id: vllm-agg-h100
    recommended: true             # bool
    hardware: { gpu: H100, count: 1 }
    runtime: { framework: vllm }
    topology: aggregated          # enum: aggregated | disaggregated
    techniques: [bf16]
    workload: { type: chat }
    deploy: { asset: recipes/llama-3-1-8b/vllm/agg/deploy.yaml }
    expected_performance: { available: false }   # add summary: when numbers exist
```

**Benchmarks use a different schema.** A `docs/benchmarks/_catalog/benchmarks/<id>.yaml` entry
validates against `docs/benchmarks/_catalog/schema.json`, whose required set is `id`, `title`, `page`,
`claim`, `subtype` (enum: `ab-test`/`feature-stack`/`topology`/`provider-comparison`/`hands-on`),
`features`, `model`, `hardware`, `traffic`, `arms`, `results`, `maintainer` — **no** `provider`,
`status`, or `targets`. The skeleton above is recipe-only; read the benchmark schema for that shape.

#### Target picker

The picker is pure CSS under the `dynamo-*` namespace — **MDX uses `className`, not `class`**, and the
exact class names matter (a wrong class name, or a `class=`-spelled wrapper, renders but filters nothing). A
**multi-target** page renders `<div className="dynamo-target-picker">` containing a
`dynamo-target-picker-title`, one `dynamo-target-picker-row` per dimension (a `dynamo-target-picker-dim`
label plus radio `<input>` + `<label>` pairs), and one `dynamo-target-picker-summary` per combination
tagged with `data-sku` / `data-usecase` / `data-variant`; tag every variant-scoped section and
Expected-Performance `<tr>` with the same `data-*`. A **single-target** page uses the static form — no
radios, no `data-*`:

```jsx
<div className="dynamo-target-picker static">
<p className="dynamo-target-picker-title">Deployment target</p>
<div className="dynamo-target-picker-summary">
<span><b>Checkpoint</b> Qwen/Qwen3-8B · BF16</span>
<span><b>Hardware</b> 2x H100 · vLLM · aggregated</span>
</div>
</div>
```

#### Move, defer, or remove a recipe

A catalog page is a triple (page + entry + nav) — never touch just one part:

- **Rename or move**: rename `_catalog/<id>.yaml` and its `id:` together, update the `page:` path, the
  `<id>` in `index.yaml`, the `- page:` in `docs/index.yml`, and the landing card; add a
  `fern/docs.yml` redirect for the old URL.
- **Defer** (hold off the rendered surface): drop `page:` from the entry, add `deferred_reason`, move
  the `<id>` from `recipes:` to `deferred_recipes:` in `index.yaml`, and delete the `.mdx` page, its
  nav `- page:`, and its landing card.
- **Remove**: delete the `.mdx`, the `_catalog/<id>.yaml`, the `index.yaml` entry, the nav `- page:`,
  and the landing card; update the model/target counts; add a redirect.

Run `python3 docs/recipes/_catalog/validate.py` after any of these.

### Add an Example or Recipe (code)

These live **outside `docs/`**, so their READMEs use the HTML-comment SPDX form (no frontmatter), and
docs link to them with absolute GitHub URLs.

- **Example** (`examples/<topic>/`): code-first directory with a `README.md`. Surface it from the
  relevant `docs/<area>/*-examples.md` page.
- **Recipe** (`recipes/<model>/`): `README.md` + `model-cache/` + `<framework>/<mode>/deploy.yaml`
  (+ optional `perf.yaml`). Add a row to the right table in
  [`recipes/README.md`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/recipes/README.md) — **Feature
  Comparison**, **Aggregated & Disaggregated**, **Functional (Not Yet Benchmarked)**, or
  **Experimental** — per
  [`recipes/CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/recipes/CONTRIBUTING.md).
  A customer-visible *rendered* recipe page is the separate catalog operation above.

---

## Callouts

Write admonitions GitHub-style; the Fern build auto-converts them (don't hand-write `<Note>`). Put
images under `docs/assets/img/` with descriptive alt text.

| GitHub Syntax | Fern Component |
|---|---|
| `> [!NOTE]` | `<Note>` |
| `> [!TIP]` | `<Tip>` |
| `> [!IMPORTANT]` | `<Info>` |
| `> [!WARNING]` | `<Warning>` |
| `> [!CAUTION]` | `<Error>` |

## Navigation: Tabs and Sections

**`docs/index.yml` is the source of truth — read it for the live structure.** The section names below
are a snapshot, not an authority; sections get added, renamed, and removed. What stays stable is the
*grammar*:

- Two tabs under `navigation:`. **`- tab: docs`** holds the main documentation; **`- tab: recipes`**
  is a flat list of `- page:` entries (`recipes/<slug>.mdx`), order mirroring
  `docs/recipes/_catalog/index.yaml`.
- In the docs tab, each section is marked by a banner comment
  (`# ==================== <Section> ====================`); a `- page:` sits under that section's
  `contents:` at 2-space indent, `path:` relative to `docs/`. In the recipes tab a `- page:` sits
  directly under `layout:`.
- Pages can carry `slug:` (overrides the label-derived slug) and `hidden: true` (reachable by URL but
  off the sidebar — used for per-benchmark pages).

Docs-tab sections **as of this writing** (confirm against `index.yml`): Getting Started, Resources,
Feature Benchmarks, Digest, Kubernetes Deployment, Feature Guides, Backends, Components, Integrations,
Design Docs, Documentation, Hidden Pages. To place a page, match the nearest existing page (see
[Add a Page](#add-a-page)) rather than reasoning from these names.

## Translations and Versioned Navs

- **Chinese translations** mirror the English page as `<name>.zh-CN.md` in the **same directory**,
  with the same SPDX header, frontmatter, and heading structure. Translate prose, not code, flags, or
  terminology (vLLM / SGLang / TensorRT-LLM stay verbatim). Keep it in sync when the English page
  changes, or don't ship it stale.
- **Versioned navs.** Author only against `docs/` on `main` (the `pages-dev` set). When a release is
  cut, the publish step copies `pages-dev/ → pages-vX.Y.Z/` and rewrites nav paths — **never** edit a
  `pages-vX.Y.Z/` directory by hand. Write portable paths so the rewrite stays clean.
### Redirects and the version model

The site serves the same nav under three prefixes: **`dev`** (slug `dev`, tracks `main`, regenerated on
every push), **Latest** (slug `/` — the unversioned root `/dynamo/...` *and* `/dynamo/latest/...`, a
frozen snapshot of the newest release), and pinned **`vX.Y.Z`** (immutable snapshots). A
`docs/index.yml` edit on `main` regenerates **only the `dev` nav**.

So a moved or renamed page (changed section or `page:` label) changes only its `/dynamo/dev/<old>` URL.
Add one dev-scoped `fern/docs.yml` redirect:

```yaml
- source: "/dynamo/dev/<old>"
  destination: "/dynamo/dev/<new>"
```

**Do not** add unversioned (`/dynamo/<old>`) or `/dynamo/latest/<old>` redirects for a main-only move:
Latest is frozen, still serves the old path, and a redirect there would break a working URL and point at
a `<new>` that won't exist in Latest until the next release re-snapshots it. Per-version redirects are a
release-time concern, not an authoring one.

## Validate

Self-check, then run the tooling.

**Before you commit**, confirm every must-fix rule in
[Style Guide Is the Standard](#style-guide-is-the-standard) holds for each file you touched — SPDX
header, frontmatter key + no body `# H1`, a nav entry under the right tab, the link rules, and no
internal or sensitive references — and that every internal link and `#anchor` resolves. The docs bot
fails the PR on any of these.

**Tooling:**

```bash
fern check                          # nav + frontmatter structure
fern docs broken-links              # link resolution
python3 docs/recipes/_catalog/validate.py   # recipe/benchmark changes only — validates BOTH catalogs
```

`fern check` and `broken-links` mirror the PR checks. The catalog validator is **not yet wired into
CI**, so run it by hand for any `_catalog/` change. Optional local preview: `fern docs dev`
(localhost:3000, hot reload, no token).

## Commit

```bash
git add docs/ fern/docs.yml          # also recipes/ examples/ fern/main.css when touched
git commit -s -m "docs: <add|update|move|remove> <page-title>"
```

## Debugging

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Duplicate H1 on the page | Remove the body `# H1`; Fern renders the title from the nav `page:` |
| SPDX line shows as a heading | Move SPDX inside the `---` frontmatter; add a real metadata key |
| `fern check` YAML error | Check 2-space indent; `- page:` must sit under a section's `contents:` |
| Missing/orphaned file | `path:` in `index.yml` must match the actual file location |
| Broken links in CI | `grep -rn "<filename>" docs/` and fix stale references |
| 404 after a move/rename | Add a **dev-scoped** `fern/docs.yml` redirect (`/dynamo/dev/<old>` → `/dynamo/dev/<new>`); don't redirect `latest`/unversioned (those serve the frozen newest release) |
| MDX parse error | Replace `<https://...>` with `[text](https://...)`; escape stray `<`/`>`; blank line after `<div ...>` and before `</div>`, code fences at column 0 |
| Page missing from site | Ensure the nav entry exists in `index.yml`; allow a few minutes for sync |
| Target picker renders but filters nothing | Use `className` (not `class`) and the exact `dynamo-target-picker` classes; and ensure the axis `value=` is in `fern/main.css` (add its hide rule) |
| `validate.py` fails (orphan/dangling/id) | `_catalog/<id>.yaml` filename, internal `id:`, and the `index.yaml` entry must all match; every deploy/perf asset path must resolve |
| Recipe page absent from the Recipes tab | Add the `- page:` under `- tab: recipes` **and** the `<id>` to `_catalog/index.yaml` |
