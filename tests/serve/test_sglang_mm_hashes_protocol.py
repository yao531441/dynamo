"""Pin sglang's MM-routing wire-protocol contracts against drift.

These fast unit tests import the installed sglang module and verify two
contracts that the dynamo Rust frontend depends on for MM-aware KV
routing:

  1. ``sglang.srt.managers.schedule_batch._compute_pad_value(hash)`` must
     equal ``MM_PAD_SHIFT_VALUE + (hash % (1 << 30))`` with
     ``MM_PAD_SHIFT_VALUE == 1_000_000``. Mirrored in Rust at
     ``dynamo_kv_router::protocols::pad_value_for_mm_hash`` (shared by the
     frontend and the kv-router's vLLM-event normalization). Pinned by
     the Rust unit ``pad_value_matches_sglang_protocol`` on our side;
     this test pins the same constants on sglang's side so a future
     sglang bump that shifts the formula fails-closed at PR time.

  2. ``GenerateReqInput.mm_hashes`` field is present. Added by
     sgl-project/sglang#25300 and currently shipped via the vendored
     patch at ``container/deps/sglang/patches/<ver>/``. A dynamo sglang
     image built without the patch — or a future upstream rename —
     would silently break MM-aware routing (workers recompute hashes
     internally, diverging from the router's pad_value substitution).
