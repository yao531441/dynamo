# Cross-implementation parity test suite

Shared test infrastructure for diffing parser / preprocess / postprocess
behavior across Dynamo, vLLM, and SGLang. Tool calling parser parity
lives in `parser/`; reasoning parser parity lives in `reasoning/`.
Other stages slot in as siblings as they land.

> **Triaging a tool call issue from a user?** Before stepping into the
> parity harness, point them at
> [docs/tool-calling/troubleshooting.md](../../docs/tool-calling/troubleshooting.md).
> That page asks users to re-run with `logprobs: true` and share the
> response, which carries the engine's raw token stream. With that captured
> output, the failure usually localizes to one of three causes: the
> **model** emitted bad tokens, the **parser was not configured**
> (`--dyn-tool-call-parser` missing or wrong family), or the **parser** ran
> and produced the wrong output. Only the third class lands here.

## Reasoning parity status

Reasoning fixtures use the same contract shape as `parser/`: each
`REASONING.*.yaml` fixture records `expected.dynamo`, `expected.vllm`,
and `expected.sglang`. A peer block can anchor to Dynamo, document a
divergence, mark an expected error, or say the peer parser is unavailable.
This part 2 PR is the seed fixture inventory and schema contract. The
fixture files are the source of truth; the reasoning table/test harness
lands in the follow-up code PR, so broad three-way coverage should not be
inferred from these files yet. Each fixture carries `ref` / `spec_ref`
provenance where available, and unavailable peer blocks must say whether
the peer parser does not exist, is not wired, or was not captured.

## Three methods (M1, M2, M3) — what each one really means

Three increasingly-realistic ways to drive the same parser logic.
They differ in **what's substituted vs what's real**, which decides
which bug class each method can catch. This diagram uses tool calling as
the concrete example; reasoning follows the same boundary, but splits
text into `reasoning_content` and normal `content` instead of `tool_calls`.

```
                                                  ┌─ engine ──────────┐
                                                  │                   │
   client ─request→ chat-template ─→ tokenize ─→ engine ─→ detokenize ─→ text ─→ parser ─→ structured output ─→ client
              ↑                                                              ↑
              └── M1 / M3 exercise this (real)                               └── M2 starts here (skips everything left)
                  M2 skips it (substituted by direct call)
```

### Method 1 — fallback-path test *(upcoming, next step)*

**What's run:** `python -m dynamo.frontend --dyn-chat-processor <vllm|sglang>`. Dynamo's frontend chat processor delegates tool calling and reasoning parsing to upstream's Python parser instead of Dynamo's Rust parser. Reference path is the default `python -m dynamo.frontend` (Dynamo's Rust parser).

**What it surfaces:** gaps in Dynamo's Rust parser that the fallback masks; bugs in Dynamo's frontend code that wraps upstream parsers.

**Status:** not yet implemented. Lives in its own harness file when added (M1 tests *Dynamo's wrapping* of upstream parsers, not parity *between* impls).

### Method 2 — parser-class test

**What's run:** in-process Python imports, all three impls in one process — no HTTP, no model, no tokenizer, no chat-template materialization:

```python
# Dynamo Rust side (via PyO3 binding)
from dynamo._core import parse_tool_calls_batch, parse_tool_calls_stream
batch_result = await parse_tool_calls_batch("kimi_k2", text, tools_json)
stream_result = await parse_tool_calls_stream("kimi_k2", chunks_json, tools_json)

# vLLM side (native Python class)
from vllm.tool_parsers import ToolParserManager
parser = ToolParserManager.get_tool_parser("kimi_k2")(tokenizer=stub)
info = parser.extract_tool_calls(text, request)

# SGLang side (native Python class)
from sglang.srt.function_call.kimik2_detector import KimiK2Detector
result = KimiK2Detector().detect_and_parse(text, tools)
```

Reasoning uses the same M2 boundary once the reasoning harness is present:
`parse_reasoning_batch` / `parse_reasoning_stream`, vLLM's
`ReasoningParserManager`, and SGLang's `ReasoningParser`.

**What it surfaces:** parser-logic divergences between Dynamo's Rust parser class and upstream's Python parser classes. The bug class is isolated from everything else in the request lifecycle.

**File:** Tool calling uses `tests/parity/toolcalling/test_parity_toolcalling.py`.
Reasoning uses the same M2 boundary, but the runnable harness lands in
the follow-up code PR as `tests/parity/reasoning/test_parity_reasoning.py`.

#### Batch vs stream mode inside M2

Batch fixtures are one-shot: the fixture provides `model_text`, the wrapper calls the implementation's batch parser once, and the harness compares the final `ParseResult`:

```text
model_text -> parse_tool_calls_batch() -> final calls/text
```

Stream fixtures are stateful: the fixture provides ordered `chunks`, the wrapper feeds each chunk through the implementation's streaming API, the implementation keeps parser state between chunks, and the wrapper aggregates emitted deltas into the same final `ParseResult` shape used by batch tests:

```text
chunk N -> parser state -> maybe content/tool delta -> aggregate -> next chunk
```

That stateful middle is the thing stream parity is trying to test. Concatenating `chunks[*].delta_text` and calling the batch parser would miss boundary bugs: partial start markers, partial argument payloads, tool call deltas split across chunks, finish-reason timing, and vLLM cases that require `delta_token_ids`.

`tests/parity/common.py` deliberately stays at the final comparison boundary (`ParseResult`, argument decoding, canonical JSON). It can host small shared helpers for aggregating stream tool call deltas, but it cannot replace the implementation-specific stream state machine. Dynamo stream parity enters Rust through the PyO3 binding; runtime-image pytest must not compile helper binaries with `cargo run`.

### Method 3 — end-to-end HTTP test *(upcoming, next step)*

**What's run:** real upstream serving binaries; constrained decoding forces them to emit the fixture text:

```bash
vllm serve <model> --load-format dummy \
  --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser kimi_k2 --port 8001 &
python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path <model> --load-format dummy \
  --tool-call-parser kimi_k2 --port 8002 &
```

Both servers receive identical chat-completion requests with `structured_outputs.regex` (vLLM) / `regex` (SGLang) forcing the assistant turn to be the fixture's `model_text` byte-for-byte; the harness captures `tool_calls` JSON from each response.

**What it surfaces:** server-stack divergences between vLLM's and SGLang's HTTP pipelines — request preprocessing, tokenizer round-trip, streaming chunk boundaries, response shaping — that class-level testing (M2) can't see.

**File:** `tests/parity/toolcalling/test_parity_e2e.py`.

### Comparison

| | M1 (upcoming) | M2 | M3 (upcoming) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **What's tested** | Dynamo frontend wrapping upstream parsers | parser **class**, in isolation | parser inside its **server** (full HTTP stack) |
| **Invocation** | `python -m dynamo.frontend` subprocess | in-process Python imports | HTTP over `/v1/chat/completions` |
| **Real engine?** | yes | no | yes (with `--load-format dummy`) |
| **Real tokenizer?** | yes | no | yes |
| **Real chat template?** | yes | no | yes |
| **Real HTTP?** | yes | no | yes |
| **Cost** | (TBD) | seconds; exact count changes with fixture coverage and installed peers | ~60 s for 30 tests (server boot dominates) |
| **GPU** | yes | none | yes (`--load-format dummy` still allocates ~2.5 GiB) |
| **CI markers** | (TBD) | `unit, pre_merge, gpu_0` | `e2e, pre_merge, gpu_1` |

All three methods (when implemented) share the same fixtures,
`ParseResult` shape, and the per-case `expected.{dynamo,vllm,sglang}` schema in YAML.
They're stacked diagnostics:

- M2 says: *"the parser class disagrees"*
- M3 says: *"the server stack also disagrees"* (or, more usefully,
  *"disagrees only at the server stack — parser class agrees"*,
  which localizes the bug to chat-template / tokenizer /
  response shaping)
- M1 says: *"Dynamo's wrapper layer disagrees with the upstream
  parser it's wrapping"*

## Tool calling parser parity status (M2)

Each row is one **parser** (one family of input wire format). Each row
also names the **model(s)** that parser is wired up for — many parsers
serve more than one model (e.g. `mistral` covers the Mistral series,
`hermes` covers Hermes-3 + various Llama variants). Columns are the
sub-case IDs from [`TOOLCALLING_CASES.md`](../../lib/parsers/TOOLCALLING_CASES.md):
top-level buckets (`1`, `3`, `9`, `10`) have no sub-cases and use a
single column; the other buckets (`2`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`) split
into `.a`–`.d` sub-cases per the per-bucket axes documented in the
PR description.

Cell values show how each engine's recorded `expected.<impl>` block relates to Dynamo (the oracle). **Convention:** a divergent peer block carries a `reason:` field iff the divergence is *intentional* (documented contract difference, vendor behavior, etc.). No `reason:` = **research-needed** — we observed the divergence but haven't classified it yet.

- `=` — all captured peers match Dynamo (peer block is an anchor ref `*d_<case>` to dynamo's, or only one peer is available and it matches).
- `V` — vLLM diverges, **intentional** (engine block has `reason:` field).
- `V?` — vLLM diverges, **research-needed** (engine block has no `reason:` yet; we observed the divergence but haven't classified it).
- `V!` — vLLM is expected to crash; `expected.vllm.error: <substring>` records the matching error.
- `S`, `S?`, `S!` — same as V/V?/V! for SGLang.
- `VS`, `VS?`, `V?S`, `V!S`, `VS!`, `V?S?`, `V!S!`, … — combinations (both engines diverge with any mix of intentional/research-needed/error).
- `n/a` — **not applicable**: engine marked `unavailable` (no parser registered for that family), OR the sub-case shape doesn't apply to this grammar (e.g. attribute-encoded DSML families have no `4.b` because there's no embedded JSON to malform).
- `—` — **missing fixture coverage**: no fixture entry exists for that family/case yet. If the case is intentionally not applicable, add an explicit table-only n/a stub with `description:` and `reason:` so the table can explain it.

### Dashboard triage indicators

Do not use `reason:` just to explain that outputs differ. A peer
`reason:` means the divergence is intentionally classified and is not
currently a Dynamo fix target. If the audit suggests the peer is more
correct, or Dynamo is trimming, dropping, misrouting, or leaking text,
remove the peer `reason:` so the dashboard renders a red `V?` / `S?`.
That is the visible "fix Dynamo or decide the contract" queue.

What to look for:

- Red `V?` / `S?` — start here. A captured peer differs and the
  divergence is not classified. If vLLM/SGLang appears more correct,
  keep it red until Dynamo is fixed or the contract is explicitly
  decided.
- `↯` — Dynamo leaks parser-owned syntax into user-visible output. For tool calling, this means tool call markup leaked into `normal_text`; for reasoning, this means Dynamo leaks reasoning markup or final-answer text.
- `V` / `S` — documented divergence. Re-audit these when an upstream
  version changes or when the reason says the peer preserves text that
  Dynamo loses. If the peer now looks like the better target, delete
  `reason:` and let the cell become red.
- `n/a` — the case or peer does not apply. Do not use `n/a` for
  behavior that is merely unknown.
- `—` — missing fixture coverage. Add a real fixture, or add an
  explicit `n/a` stub with a reason.

For reasoning parity, the default contract is a lossless split:
remove the reasoning delimiters, but preserve the text on each side of
the delimiter or tool-boundary unless the fixture explicitly documents
normalization. Tool call text in `normal_text` is not a reasoning leak;
it is the downstream handoff to the tool calling parser.

19 parsers total — split into the **Top-N models** we prioritize and
**Others** wired into the harness for completeness. Both sections sorted
alphabetically within themselves.

The table isn't checked in — it would drift behind the YAML every time a
case is added or a peer block flips. Generate it on demand and save it
somewhere you can browse:

```bash
# Markdown — paste into a PR description or browse in any editor.
python3 tests/parity/generate_parity_table.py toolcalling

# HTML table — clickable cells link to the source fixture YAML; hover over any
# non-= cell to see the case description and the divergence reason.
python3 tests/parity/generate_parity_table.py toolcalling --html > tests/parity/toolcalling/PARITY.html
```

Run from the repo root so the HTML's relative `<a href=...>` links to
fixture YAMLs resolve when you open `tests/parity/toolcalling/PARITY.html`
in a browser. Generated table output is for local viewing only — don't
check it in; the generator is the contract. Rows are the 19 parsers
(Top-N first, then Others, alphabetical within each). Columns are the
sub-case IDs from [`TOOLCALLING_CASES.md`](../../lib/parsers/TOOLCALLING_CASES.md).
The generator reads every `fixtures/<family>/TOOLCALLING.*.yaml` and emits
one cell per `(family, sub-case)` using the legend above.

**Example output** (illustrative — cell values are made up, **not** a
snapshot of current fixtures; run the script for the real table):

```text
| model       | parser     | 1 | 2.a | 2.b | 2.c | 2.d | 3 | ... | 9 | 10 |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Top-N models** |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Kimi K2.6   | kimi_k2    | = | =   | =   | VS  | =   | = | ... | = | =  |
| GLM 5.1     | glm47      | = | =   | n/a | V   | =   | = | ... | = | =  |
| gpt-oss     | harmony †  | S | S   | n/a | S?  | S?  | = | ... | = | S  |
```

Read a row left-to-right: `=` = all captured peers match Dynamo,
`V` / `S` = that engine diverges with a documented reason (rendered
as documented divergence in the HTML table), `V?` / `S?` = divergence
not yet classified (research-needed), `n/a` = case doesn't apply or a
peer is unavailable.

### Footnotes

† vLLM has no engine peer (or returns `UNAVAILABLE` at runtime, e.g.
  `harmony#vllm` requires token IDs not text). Cells show SGLang status
  only when SGLang is wired; otherwise the row is fully `n/a`.
§ SGLang `v0.5.10.post1` (the version pinned in `container/context.yaml`)
  has no peer detector for this family. Cells show vLLM status only when
  vLLM is wired; otherwise the row is fully `n/a`. **This may change with
  future SGLang releases** — re-audit on each version bump.

`nemotron_deci` and `nemotron_nano` carry both daggers (`†§`) — neither
upstream has a peer parser, so the rows are fully `n/a`. They live under
**Others** for completeness; Dynamo-only self-parity could be added in a
follow-up but yields no cross-implementation signal.

### Coverage gaps — missing upstream peer parsers

Snapshot pinned to **SGLang `v0.5.10.post1`** (per `container/context.yaml`)
and the vLLM version installed in the parity dev image. **This may change
with future releases** — re-audit on every SGLang / vLLM bump.

**SGLang `v0.5.10.post1` has no detector for 4 families that DO have a vLLM peer (`§` in matrix):**
`deepseek_v4`, `gemma4`, `jamba`, `phi4`. The harness skips the SGLang side
of these rows at runtime (`UNAVAILABLE: SGLang has no detector for
family='<name>'`); cells carry vLLM-only signal.

**`llama3_json` is also `§` in the matrix but for a different reason** —
SGLang does ship a Llama 3 detector ([sglang tool-parser docs](https://sgl-project.github.io/advanced_features/tool_parser.html));
we just haven't wired it in `_FAMILY_TO_SGLANG_DETECTOR` yet. TODO follow-up
to add it and regenerate the `llama3_json` SGLang fixtures.

**Neither upstream has a peer parser for 2 families (`†§` in matrix):**
`nemotron_deci`, `nemotron_nano`. Rows are fully `n/a`.

Wrapper enumeration: `tests/parity/toolcalling/sglang.py::_FAMILY_TO_SGLANG_DETECTOR`
(missing keys = missing detectors). Adding an SGLang detector for any
`§`-marked family above (either upstream-shipped in a newer SGLang release,
or by us standing up a Dynamo-side stub) would let the harness surface
`S`/`VS` divergences on those rows; today they carry only `V`/`=`
(vLLM-side).

**Hot columns:**
- `TOOLCALLING.batch.4` (malformed JSON) and `TOOLCALLING.batch.5` (missing
  end-token) — recovery is impl-defined per `TOOLCALLING_CASES.md`;
  divergences are documented rather than asserted-against.
- `TOOLCALLING.batch.1.{b,c,d}` / `TOOLCALLING.batch.2.e` (simple normal-text
  placement) — vLLM and SGLang often drop trailing text after the
  wrapper across XML-style families.
- `harmony/sglang` — 8 of 10 cases divergent because SGLang's
  `GptOssDetector` requires the strict
  `<|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary` envelope where Dynamo
  accepts bare commentary.

What's **not** fully covered yet: format-specific surfaces such as
`TOOLCALLING.fmt.*`, `TOOLCALLING.xml.*`, and `TOOLCALLING.harmony.*` still have
Rust-only coverage in places. `TOOLCALLING.stream.*` fixtures exist, but
coverage is still being expanded family by family.

## Run the parity harness

One-liner from inside a Dynamo devcontainer:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=lib/bindings/python/src python3 -m pytest tests/parity/toolcalling/test_parity_toolcalling.py
```

`PYTHONPATH=lib/bindings/python/src` is required — that's where the
PyO3 binding (`dynamo._core`) lives. Without it every Dynamo case
skips. vLLM / SGLang packages must also be installed for their cases
to run (otherwise they skip cleanly).

**Common filters** — pick what to run:

```bash
# One family across every bucket
... -k "kimi_k2"

# One sub-case across every family + every impl
... -k "TOOLCALLING.batch.1.c"

# Exactly one (family, sub-case, impl)
... "tests/parity/toolcalling/test_parity_toolcalling.py::test_parity[kimi_k2/TOOLCALLING.batch.1.c#vllm]"
```

**From the host** (outside the container), wrap the command in
`docker exec <container> bash -c 'cd /workspace && …'`. Find the
container with `docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep vsc-dynamo2 | head -1`.

**Baseline:** exact counts change as fixture coverage lands and as the
local devcontainer gains or loses vLLM/SGLang packages. There is no
`xfail` count — divergent peers are recorded with concrete
`expected.<impl>` blocks and assert positively against them. Failure
modes are **assertion mismatches** when an engine drifts away from its
recorded block; captured-peer parity is when every non-`n/a`, non-missing
cell is `=` (all captured peers produce byte-identical output on every
fixture).

## Resolving divergences (8 steps)

Each non-`=` cell in the generated table is a divergent `expected.<impl>` block
in the family's YAML fixture (concrete `calls` + `normal_text`, or
`{error: <substring>}`, or `{unavailable: <reason>}`). Cells that
match Dynamo are stored as anchor refs `*d_<case>` to the dynamo
block. Goal: drive the non-`=` count toward zero by fixing whichever
side is wrong. Worked example: `kimi_k2 / TOOLCALLING.batch.1.c → V`
(vLLM drops trailing text after the wrapper).

### 1. Pick a cell

Run `generate_parity_table.py`; pick any `V?` / `S?` / `V?S?` cell if
you are classifying unknown divergences, or any `V` / `S` / `VS` cell
if you are intentionally changing an already-classified behavior.

### 2. Look up the side-by-side diff in the YAML

Open `tests/parity/toolcalling/fixtures/kimi_k2/TOOLCALLING.batch.8.yaml`
(legacy filename for the text-placement cases) and find the
`TOOLCALLING.batch.1.c:` block. The `expected:` block carries all
three engines' actual recorded output, so the diff is right there —
**no harness run needed to read it.**

```yaml
TOOLCALLING.batch.1.c:
  description: Narration after tool call only
  ref: originated from https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/.../test_kimi_k2_tool_parser.py#L435
  model_text: |-
    <|tool_calls_section_begin|>...
  expected:
    dynamo: &d_8_b
      calls: [...]
      normal_text: "Let me know if you need more."   # Dynamo
    vllm:
      calls: [...]
      normal_text: ''                                 # vLLM (drops trailing)
      reason: "drops trailing normal_text after tool call wrapper end"
    sglang: *d_8_b                                    # SGLang matches Dynamo
```

Read the three blocks side-by-side: dynamo block is the oracle, peer
blocks show that engine's concrete output (or `*d_<case>` if it
matched). The `reason:` line (when present) classifies the divergence
as intentional; absence = research-needed.

If `ref: originated from <url>` is present, the URL points at the
upstream vLLM/SGLang test the shape was derived from (useful context).

### 3. Reproduce locally

```bash
PYTHONPATH=lib/bindings/python/src python3 -m pytest \
  "tests/parity/toolcalling/test_parity_toolcalling.py::test_parity[kimi_k2/TOOLCALLING.batch.1.c#vllm]" \
  -v --tb=short
```

Impl tag is `#vllm` or `#sglang`.

### 4. Pick an alignment target

Parity isn't about declaring a winner. It's about picking what
Dynamo should align *to* for this (family, case) so the fix has a
clear oracle. Apply the priorities below in order: the first matching
rule wins, and the chosen target is recorded in
`reason:` (or `spec_ref:`) so future readers see the trail.

**Alignment-target priority (highest wins):**

0. **Upstream spec, if one exists.** Chat template, tokenizer
   config, model-card section, vendor docs. Spec is the unambiguous
   oracle; if both vendors disagree with it, both are upstream bugs
   to file. Record `spec_ref:` in the fixture (step 8). Rare —
   most families have no written spec; skip to 1.
1. **The non-leaking vendor.** Tool-calling tags like `<｜tool_call｜>`,
   `<tool_call>`, `[TOOL_CALLS]`, etc. must never reach the
   `message.content` shown to an end user. If one vendor leaks and
   the other doesn't, align to the non-leaking one.
2. **The impacted customer's vendor.** If a prod deployment is broken
   because of a divergence, align to that customer's vendor *now* to
   unblock. Record incident + vendor chosen in
   `reason:` (e.g.
   `"aligned to SGLang per Acme prod report 2026-05-12; vLLM variant leaks <|tool_call|> tag into content"`).
   Don't re-litigate in the same PR — ship the unblock and follow
   up separately.
3. **Vendor consensus.** When vLLM and SGLang agree, that shared
   shape is the target. When they disagree and none of the above
   applies, pick the one that better satisfies priority 1 (no leak)
   and record why in `reason:`.

**Once the target is picked, the action depends on where Dynamo stands:**

- **Spec is the target, a vendor diverges** → file an upstream bug
  at `vllm-project/vllm` or `sgl-project/sglang`, link from `reason:`.
- **A vendor is the target, Dynamo diverges** → fix Dynamo (step 5).
- **A vendor is the target, Dynamo already matches, the *other*
  vendor diverges intentionally** → leave the divergence entry,
  file an upstream bug at the disagreeing vendor.
- **Two customers need different behavior on the same case** → file a
  follow-up for a parser-side runtime parameter or environment variable,
  then link that follow-up from `reason:`.
- **Genuinely ambiguous** (no spec, both vendors leak, no incident)
  → discuss before touching code.

> **Sad reality:** sometimes the priority chain is unreconcilable
> across customers — one prod deployment needs vLLM-style output,
> another needs SGLang-style. We may eventually need a parser-side
> param or env (e.g. `DYN_PARSER_<family>_MODE=vllm|sglang`) to flip

> switch can be added later from a known set.

### 5. Fix the parser

Edit `lib/parsers/src/tool_calling/<family>/...rs`. Rebuild the PyO3
binding so `capture_toolcalling_outputs --impl dynamo --merge --overwrite-if-exists`
runs against your change:

```bash
cd lib/bindings/python && maturin develop --uv && cd -
```

See [the build guide](../../docs/getting-started/building-from-source.md)
for prerequisites.

### 6. Refresh `expected.dynamo` + re-capture engine outputs

Step 1 — refresh Dynamo's oracle output (your fix changed it):

```bash
PYTHONPATH=lib/bindings/python/src python3 \
  -m tests.parity.toolcalling.capture_toolcalling_outputs \
  --impl dynamo --merge --overwrite-if-exists
```

Step 2 — re-capture vLLM and SGLang outputs against the now-current
fixtures so anchor refs (`*d_<case>`) flip on/off correctly. Run in
each engine's container:

```bash
# vllm container — drift check (default, read-only)
python3 -m tests.parity.toolcalling.capture_toolcalling_outputs --impl vllm
# sglang container — drift check (default, read-only)
python3 -m tests.parity.toolcalling.capture_toolcalling_outputs --impl sglang
```

The default (no flag) drift-check reports which cases have engine
output differing from the recorded fixture. Once you've sanity-checked
the drift, re-run with `--merge --overwrite-if-exists` to write the new
engine outputs into the YAMLs (matching engines become anchor refs;
divergent ones become concrete blocks).

### 7. Re-run pytest

```bash
PYTHONPATH=lib/bindings/python/src python3 -m pytest \
  tests/parity/toolcalling/test_parity_toolcalling.py -q --tb=no
```

The test asserts each engine's actual output equals its recorded
`expected.<impl>` block. If an engine drifts (e.g. you fixed Dynamo
but didn't re-capture peer outputs), the test fails with a diff
pointing at the YAML edit needed:

```text
FAILED tests/parity/toolcalling/test_parity_toolcalling.py::test_parity[kimi_k2/TOOLCALLING.batch.1.c#vllm]
       expected: {'calls': [...], 'normal_text': ''}
       got:      {'calls': [...], 'normal_text': 'Let me know if you need more.'}
```

### 8. Collapse the peer block to an anchor ref + add spec_ref + commit

When an engine now matches Dynamo, the concrete peer block becomes
an anchor reference (`*d_<case>`) to dynamo's block. The Step 6
`capture_toolcalling_outputs.py` re-run with merge does this
automatically; if you're editing by hand, replace the concrete block
verbatim:

```yaml
expected:
  dynamo: &d_1_c
    calls: [...]
    normal_text: '...'
  vllm: *d_1_c        # ← was a concrete `vllm:` block; now ref to dynamo
  sglang: *d_1_c      # (same, if SGLang also now matches)
```

Add a `spec_ref:` field directly to the case in its fixture YAML so
the paper trail survives — point at whatever made V/S right (spec
section, model card, GH issue, upstream PR, or the team-decision doc):

```yaml
TOOLCALLING.batch.1.c:
  description: Narration after tool call only
  ref: originated from https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/.../test_kimi_k2_tool_parser.py#L435
  spec_ref: https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/tool-call-spec#L42  # or GH issue / PR url
  model_text: |-
    ...
  tools:
  - ...
```

Then regenerate the table so the cell flips:

```bash
python3 tests/parity/generate_parity_table.py toolcalling --html > tests/parity/toolcalling/PARITY.html
```

Pytest should now be fully green; the table cell flips to `=`.

Then follow the repo PR workflow, staging only the files changed for the
parser fix and fixture refresh.

## When *not* to fix — permanent divergences

The set of concrete divergent blocks should shrink, not grow. But a
few classes stay recorded forever (intentional, by design):

- **`TOOLCALLING.batch.4` (malformed args) and `TOOLCALLING.batch.5`
  (missing end-token)** — impl-defined recovery per
  `TOOLCALLING_CASES.md`. Each parser picks its own behavior (drop,
  recover, fall back to string, error). Parity not expected.
- **Schema-driven coercion vs parser-layer preservation** —
  e.g. `{"celsius": "20"}` against `celsius: integer`. Some
  parsers coerce at the parser layer, others preserve raw and
  defer coercion downstream. Both defensible.

Everything else is a candidate to fix. Permanent divergences should
carry a `reason:` field that classifies them as intentional (so the
table shows `V`/`S`, not `V?`/`S?`).

## Fixture file schema

Two file layouts coexist per family. The loader merges them:

```
<family>/TOOLCALLING.batch.yaml          ← legacy flat: holds top-level cases (1, 2, ..., 10)
<family>/TOOLCALLING.batch.<n>.yaml      ← per-top-level-case: holds sub-cases <n>.a, <n>.b, ...
```

The per-case file is only created when a top-level case grows sub-cases.
Once any sub-case `TOOLCALLING.batch.<n>.<sub>` is introduced, the bare
`TOOLCALLING.batch.<n>` key migrates out of the flat file into the per-case
file. Case-ID uniqueness across the two files is the merge invariant.

Both file shapes use the same Variant A schema (per-case `expected:`
keyed by impl, peers as anchor refs when matching dynamo, concrete
blocks when diverging):

```yaml
family: kimi_k2
mode: batch
cases:
  TOOLCALLING.batch.1.a:
    description: Single tool call (happy path)
    model_text: |-
      <|tool_calls_section_begin|>...
    tools:
    - name: ...
      parameters: {...}
    expected:
      dynamo: &d_1
        calls:
        - name: ...
          arguments: {...}
        normal_text: ''
      vllm: *d_1           # vLLM matches Dynamo
      sglang: *d_1         # SGLang matches Dynamo
  TOOLCALLING.batch.1.b:        # sub-case keys also valid
    description: Narration before tool call only
    ref: originated from https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/<sha>/tests/tool_parsers/test_<family>_tool_parser.py#L<line>
    model_text: |-
      ...
    expected:
      dynamo: &d_1_b
        calls: [...]
        normal_text: 'I will check the weather.'
      vllm:                # vLLM diverges — concrete output recorded
        calls: [...]
        normal_text: 'I will check the weather. '
        reason: "preserves trailing space; Dynamo trims it"
      sglang:              # SGLang has no peer parser for this family
        unavailable: "SGLang has no detector for family='kimi_k2'"
```

**Peer block forms** (one of):
- **`*d_<case>`** anchor ref — engine matches Dynamo's output.
- **`{calls, normal_text}`** — engine produces a different concrete
  output. Optional `reason: <string>` classifies as intentional;
  absence = research-needed.
- **`{error: <substring>}`** — engine is expected to crash. Test
  passes if the engine's actual error contains the substring.
- **`{unavailable: <msg>}`** — no parser registered for this family.
  Test skips with the message.

### Reasoning fixture schema

Reasoning fixtures live under `tests/parity/reasoning/fixtures/` and use
the same top-level shape, but their concrete output blocks are:

```yaml
reasoning_text: ...
normal_text: ...
```

They do not use `calls`. `reasoning_text` is the hidden reasoning split.
`normal_text` is user-visible text or the text handed to a downstream
tool call parser.

Case-level parser inputs may also include `chat_template_kwargs` when a
peer parser needs explicit template flags such as `enable_thinking`.

A case with `description` and `reason` but no `expected` block is an
explicit not-applicable/table-only stub. The harness skips it rather
than treating it as missing coverage.

`dynamo_leak: true` is a temporary table annotation for a known Dynamo reasoning split bug. Use it only when Dynamo leaks reasoning markup or final-answer text. Do not use it when valid downstream tool call text is preserved in `normal_text`; that is the intended handoff to the tool call parser.

GPT-OSS/Harmony is the case that can look like a leak at the reasoning layer but is normal: directed `commentary to=functions.*` blocks are tool-call protocol text, and Dynamo feeds reasoning `normal_text` to the Harmony tool-call parser. The final OpenAI response should contain structured `tool_calls`, not this markup in user-visible `content`; stripping it in the reasoning parser would silently drop the tool call before the tool parser sees it.

The `ref` field is required on per-sub-case files
(`TOOLCALLING.<mode>.<n>.yaml`) and takes one of three forms:

- **`ref: originated from <url>`** — there's an upstream test exercising
  this same shape on this same family. The fixture's `model_text` may
  be freshly authored (templated narration, consistent function/args
  across families) rather than copied verbatim, but the shape is
  directly traceable to the linked upstream test. The URL names the
  impl: `vllm-project/vllm` → vLLM, `sgl-project/sglang` → SGLang.
- **`ref: dynamo`** — authored fresh in this repo, no upstream peer.
  Most sub-case taxonomy fillers (`.b` post-only, `.d` between-calls)
  land here because vLLM/SGLang don't test those shapes.
- **`ref: derived from TOOLCALLING.<mode>.<n>[.<sub>]`** — authored in this repo by transforming an existing parity case into a new surface. Streaming fixtures commonly use this when the same `model_text` shape is split into `chunks` or truncated at a stream boundary.

Every sub-case carries one of these three states; there's no "no
provenance" state. The legacy flat `TOOLCALLING.<mode>.yaml` (cases without
sub-cases) does NOT carry `ref` — those entries predate the convention.

#### Legacy: `TODO(research)` comments

Some older fixtures (pre-Variant-A) still carry inline YAML comments
of the form `# TODO(research): <impl> diverges — <reason>` below the
case body. Those were the side-by-side diff under the previous schema
where peer divergences lived in a Python registry, not in YAML. With
Variant A's `expected.<impl>` blocks, the comments are redundant — the
authoritative per-engine output is in the YAML data itself.

The `embed_divergence_comments.py` helper still exists for re-embedding
those comments after a regen pass, but new divergences should record
their reasoning in the `reason:` field of the peer block, not in a
comment.

Case keys are the full IDs from
[`lib/parsers/TOOLCALLING_CASES.md`](../../lib/parsers/TOOLCALLING_CASES.md)
(`TOOLCALLING.batch.1.a` … `TOOLCALLING.batch.31.b`, including sub-cases like
`TOOLCALLING.batch.1.b`). They match the pytest
parametrize IDs directly, so a single `grep TOOLCALLING.batch.1.b` finds the
case across docs, fixtures, and Rust source comments.

`model_text` uses YAML's literal block scalar (`|-`) so multi-line
wire formats (XML-style families, harmony) read as the actual text
the model would emit, not a `\n`-escaped one-liner. UTF-8 with
`allow_unicode=True`, so DeepSeek special tokens (`｜` U+FF5C, `▁`
U+2581) appear as literal characters rather than escape sequences.

A side-effect of letting pyyaml choose the best block-scalar header
for every value: `normal_text` occasionally emits as the
unusual-looking `|2+`. Decoding this in three pieces:

- `|` — literal block scalar (preserve newlines as written).
- `2` — explicit indent indicator: "content is indented 2 spaces."
  pyyaml normally auto-detects indent from the first content line;
  it falls back to the explicit form when the body is blank-only
  and there's nothing to detect from.
- `+` — "keep" chomping: preserve all trailing newlines (`-` strips
  them, no indicator clips to one).

So `|2+` followed by one blank line decodes to `"\n"` — a single
newline. It shows up where the divergence between Dynamo and an
upstream impl is literally one inter-wrapper newline character (e.g.
back-to-back `</tool_calls>` / `<tool_calls>` fence pairs where
Dynamo treats the `\n` between them as `normal_text` and the impl
treats it as part of the wrapper). pyyaml round-trips the value to
its canonical form; the header looks cryptic but it's just `"\n"`.

## Why families' YAMLs look so similar (and why that's the point)

Open any two family files side-by-side and the case shells look
nearly identical: same `description` strings, same `tools` schemas,
same case keys `"TOOLCALLING.batch.1"`–`"TOOLCALLING.batch.10"`. **That's by
design** — `TOOLCALLING.batch.N` is the same logical scenario across every
family (run `generate_parity_table.py` for the full list).

So a reviewer can grep `TOOLCALLING.batch.4` across all 10 families and
immediately see how each parser handles the same scenario. The
repetition *is* the diff: it's what makes per-case cross-family
comparison trivial.

### What changes per family

**1. `model_text`** — every family has its own wire format.
`case 1` ("single happy-path call") encoded by each:

| family | model_text (truncated) |
|---|---|
| `kimi_k2` | `<\|tool_calls_section_begin\|><\|tool_call_begin\|>functions.get_weather:0…` |
| `qwen3_coder` | `<tool_call>\n<function=get_weather>\n<parameter=location>\nNYC\n</parameter>…` |
| `glm47` | `<tool_call>get_weather<arg_key>location</arg_key><arg_value>NYC</arg_value>…` |
| `deepseek_v3_1` | `<｜tool▁calls▁begin｜><｜tool▁call▁begin｜>get_weather<｜tool▁sep｜>{…}…` |
| `harmony` | `<\|channel\|>commentary to=functions.get_weather <\|constrain\|>json<\|message\|>…` |
| `minimax_m2` | `<minimax:tool_call>\n<invoke name="get_weather">\n<parameter name="location">…` |
| `nemotron_deci` | `<TOOLCALL>[{"name": "get_weather", "arguments": {"location": "NYC"}}]</TOOLCALL>` |

**2. `expected`** — sometimes also differs, when Dynamo's per-family
parser quirks make the same logical scenario produce different
parsed output. Example: `case 4` (malformed input) — the
malformations themselves vary (each is malformed in a way that's
natural for that family's wire format), and Dynamo recovers them
differently:

```
kimi_k2/batch.4    expected.calls[0].arguments = "{\"location\":\"NYC\""
                   ↑ truncated raw string — Dynamo's kimi_k2 parser
                     surfaces the malformed bytes verbatim

qwen3_coder/batch.4 expected.calls[0].arguments = {"location": "NYC"}
                   ↑ recovered into a proper dict — Dynamo's
                     qwen3_coder parser is lenient with missing tags
```

Both are valid per-family Dynamo contracts. Cross-impl divergences
(vLLM and SGLang doing something *different* from Dynamo on the
same case) are visible by reading the per-case `expected.{dynamo,vllm,sglang}` triple in the YAML fixture — anchor refs (`*d_<case>`) mark agreement, concrete blocks mark divergence
as recorded peer outputs with a one-sentence reason when the divergence
is classified.

**3. `tools`** — sometimes minor parameter-name differences
(e.g., `city` vs `location`, `unit` field present or not), carried
over from the original Rust unit tests that seeded each family's
fixtures.

If you're *adding* a new case, mirror the case shape across all
applicable families — the harness counts on case N meaning the
same thing everywhere.

## Regenerating fixtures

Run from the repo root inside a container with `dynamo._core` built
(M2's PyO3 binding). The same `capture_toolcalling_outputs` script handles
all three impls — pass `--impl dynamo|vllm|sglang`:

```bash
# Default: drift-check (read-only). Reports cases where the recorded
# `expected.<impl>` disagrees with what the parser now produces.
python3 -m tests.parity.toolcalling.capture_toolcalling_outputs --impl dynamo

# Non-destructive populate: fill `expected.<impl>` only for cases that
# don't have it yet (newly authored cases).
python3 -m tests.parity.toolcalling.capture_toolcalling_outputs --impl dynamo --merge

# Refresh: re-run the parser for every case on disk and overwrite the
# recorded block. Use this only when parser behavior intentionally changed.
python3 -m tests.parity.toolcalling.capture_toolcalling_outputs \
  --impl dynamo --merge --overwrite-if-exists
```

(The `-m` invocation is required — running the script directly puts
`tests/parity/toolcalling/` on `sys.path`, which makes the local
`dynamo.py` wrapper shadow the real `dynamo` package.)

After regenerating, run `git diff tests/parity/toolcalling/fixtures/` to
review the change before staging. Any peer blocks (`expected.vllm`,
`expected.sglang`) attached to a case are preserved across
`--overwrite-if-exists` runs, so refreshing `expected.dynamo` won't
accidentally drop someone else's captured engine output.

## Future stages (sibling directories)

```
tests/parity/
├── parser/         (today)
├── reasoning/      (today)
├── postprocess/    (future) — parser output → OpenAI wire response
└── preprocess/     (future) — request preprocessing, chat-template
```

Each stage has its own fixtures, wrappers, and test file but
reuses the shared `common.py` (`ParseResult`-style shape) and
`conftest.py` (session-scoped server boots) at this level. Out of
scope today; see `lib/parsers/TOOLCALLING_CASES.md`,
`components/src/dynamo/frontend/tests/FRONTEND_CASES.md`, and
`lib/parsers/PIPELINE_CASES.md` for the surrounding taxonomy that
will guide which stages are worth adding when.

## Eventual goal: YAML fixtures as the single source of truth

Today there's overlap between this harness's fixtures and the
hand-written Rust unit tests under `lib/parsers/src/tool_calling/*`
— for the ~190 black-box "given input X, parser returns Y" tests,
the same input + expected appears in both places (the M2 fixtures
were originally extracted from those Rust tests by hand).

The intended end state is **one set of fixtures, multiple thin
harnesses**, in subsequent PRs:

```
tests/parity/toolcalling/fixtures/<family>/TOOLCALLING.batch.yaml
        │
        ├── Python harness (M2 / M3) — already reads it
        └── Rust harness (future)    — would read it too,
                                       at cargo-test speed,
                                       no Python required
```

What that buys:

- **No duplicated test data.** Adding a case in YAML immediately
  covers Dynamo (Rust harness), Dynamo-via-PyO3 (M2), and
  vLLM/SGLang servers (M3). Today, adding a Rust test means
  hand-mirroring the case into M2's YAML fixtures if you want
  cross-implementation coverage.
- **Rust devs keep their fast feedback loop.** `cargo test`
  still finishes in ~0.5 s; no Python build needed.
- **Each impl is tested in its native language.** Closer to
  production semantics than going through PyO3 just to assert
  a Rust contract.

What stays in Rust-only tests after the migration:

- White-box tests on internal helpers (`detect_tool_call_start_*`,
  `find_tool_call_end_position_*`, regex-fallback paths). These
  test parser-internal state, not parity, and aren't exposed
  via PyO3. ~120 of the ~498 Rust tests fall here.
- Tokenizer / config / panic-class tests. Single-impl by nature.

Effort sketch (separate PRs after M2 + M3 land):

- **PR-X:** Rust harness that reads `TOOLCALLING.batch.yaml`, dispatches
  to `try_tool_call_parse_<family>(...)`, asserts on `expected`.
  ~1-2 days.
- **PR-Y:** Mechanical migration — delete the ~70 hand-written
  black-box Rust tests now redundant with the shared fixtures.
  ~6 hours.
- **PR-Z:** Same shape extended to format-conditional and
  customer-incident regressions (~150 more cases). ~2-3 days.
- (deferred) Streaming variant. Needs new `TOOLCALLING.stream.*`
  schema + streaming PyO3 + streaming Rust harness. Roughly
  the size of the original M3 work.

Until then, M2 and the Rust suite both exist; for ~100 cases they
test the same Dynamo contract through different surfaces. M2's
real value-add is the cross-implementation half (vLLM and SGLang).

## Adding a new parser family

1. Add the family name to Dynamo's parser registry (Rust side).
2. Author a fixture YAML at
   `tests/parity/toolcalling/fixtures/<family>/TOOLCALLING.batch.yaml` covering
   the `TOOLCALLING.batch.<n>` cases that apply (mirror an existing
   family's case shape — see `fixtures/kimi_k2/TOOLCALLING.batch.yaml`).
   Each case minimally needs `description`, `ref`, `model_text`,
   and `tools`. Author by hand or copy-edit from an upstream test.
   AI can draft case shells, but humans must review them against
   `TOOLCALLING_CASES.md` and the model format before merging.
3. Run `python3 -m tests.parity.toolcalling.capture_toolcalling_outputs --impl dynamo --merge`
   to fill in each case's `expected.dynamo` by running Dynamo against
   `model_text` + `tools`. Cases that already have `expected.dynamo`
   are left alone.
4. Add the family's vLLM and SGLang dispatch entries to
   `_FAMILY_TO_VLLM_KEY` (`vllm.py`) and
   `_FAMILY_TO_SGLANG_DETECTOR` (`sglang.py`).
5. Populate vLLM and SGLang outputs for the new family by running
   `python3 -m tests.parity.toolcalling.capture_toolcalling_outputs --impl <vllm|sglang> --merge`
   inside each engine's container. The merge writes anchor refs to
   dynamo for matching engines, concrete `{calls, normal_text}` for
   divergent ones, and `{unavailable: <reason>}` when the wrapper marks
   the case as such. Cases where the engine raised (any error other
   than UNAVAILABLE) are skipped — hand-record those as
   `{error: <substring>}` so the test asserts on a stable signature
   rather than the full volatile message. Add a `reason:` field to
   intentional divergences so they show as `V`/`S` not `V?`/`S?` in the
   table.
6. Regenerate the table: `python3 tests/parity/generate_parity_table.py toolcalling --html > tests/parity/toolcalling/PARITY.html`.
