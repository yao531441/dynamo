title: SGLang for Agentic Workloads
subtitle: Priority scheduling and session-aware radix KV for agentic serving
---

This guide covers SGLang-specific configuration for agentic serving with Dynamo. It explains which SGLang engine flags to enable, how Dynamo's [agent hints](../../components/frontend/nvext.md#agent-hints) map to SGLang behavior, and how to tag radix KV by session.

## Overview

Agentic workloads (tool-calling loops, multi-turn reasoning, code generation pipelines) have different performance characteristics than batch inference:

- **Prefix-heavy**: Successive turns share a growing conversation prefix. KV cache reuse is critical for low TTFT.
- **Priority-sensitive**: Some requests (user-facing agent turns) matter more than background tasks.
- **Long-lived**: Conversations span minutes to hours. Cache eviction under memory pressure can destroy accumulated KV state.

Dynamo's agent hints give the router per-request metadata. SGLang's engine flags control how that metadata affects scheduling and eviction on the worker. For the cross-layer Dynamo priority semantics, see [Priority Scheduling](../../components/router/priority-scheduling.md).

## SGLang Engine Flags

### Priority Scheduling

Enable priority-based scheduling so the engine respects the `priority` value from `nvext.agent_hints.priority`:

```bash
python -m dynamo.sglang \
  --model-path <model> \
  --enable-priority-scheduling \
  ...
```

| Flag                           | Description                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--enable-priority-scheduling` | Enables priority-based request scheduling instead of FCFS. |

When priority scheduling is enabled, the engine uses the `priority` field from `nvext.agent_hints` to order requests in its internal queue. Requests with higher effective priority are scheduled before lower-priority ones. Ties are broken by arrival time.

Router queue priority is configured separately on the frontend with
`--router-queue-threshold`; see
[Router Configuration and Tuning](../../components/router/router-configuration.md#routing-behavior).

### Priority-Based KV Cache Eviction

By default, SGLang evicts radix tree nodes using LRU. You can switch to priority-based eviction so that low-priority cache entries are evicted before high-priority ones:

```bash
python -m dynamo.sglang \
  --model-path <model> \
  --radix-eviction-policy priority \
  ...
```

| Flag                      | Values            | Default | Description                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--radix-eviction-policy` | `lru`, `priority` | `lru`   | Eviction strategy for the GPU radix cache. `priority` uses a heap ordered by the request's priority value. |

This does **not** require HiCache. It controls GPU-only radix tree eviction. When the GPU KV cache is full:

- **`lru`**: Evicts the least recently used leaf nodes first.
- **`priority`**: Evicts lowest-priority leaf nodes first. Nodes with equal priority fall back to LRU ordering.

#### Interaction with HiCache

When both `--radix-eviction-policy priority` and `--enable-hierarchical-cache` are enabled, priority affects eviction at both tiers:

| Event         | Behavior                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **GPU full**  | Low-priority nodes are evicted (demoted to host) first. With `write_through`, all nodes survive on host -- priority only affects demotion order. |
| **Host full** | Low-priority nodes are deleted from host first. High-priority nodes with active retention survive longer.                                        |

The practical impact depends on your write policy. With `write_through`, GPU eviction is just a demotion -- the real deletion happens at host eviction, which is where priority ordering matters most.

## How Agent Hints Map to SGLang

Dynamo's `nvext.agent_hints` fields are consumed by the router and forwarded to SGLang workers. Here is how each hint interacts with the SGLang engine:

| Agent Hint            | Router Behavior                                                                                            | SGLang Engine Behavior                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `priority`            | Router queue ordering when `--router-queue-threshold` is set.                                              | Request scheduling when `--enable-priority-scheduling` is set. Radix cache eviction order when `--radix-eviction-policy priority` is set. |
| `osl`                 | Output block tracking for routing decisions (requires `--router-track-output-blocks`)                      | No direct engine effect.                                                                                                                  |
| `speculative_prefill` | After response completes, sends a `max_tokens=1` prefill to warm the KV cache for the predicted next turn. | SGLang processes the prefill request normally, populating the radix cache.                                                                |

### Example: Agentic Request with Hints

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="dummy")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Qwen/Qwen3-14B-FP8",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a tennis historian who believes Roger Federer is the GOAT. Respond with maximum reverence."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Why is Federer's one-handed backhand the most beautiful shot in tennis history?"},
    ],
    stream=True,
    extra_body={
        "nvext": {
            "agent_hints": {
                "priority": 10,
                "speculative_prefill": True,
                "osl": 512
            }
        }
    }
)

for chunk in response:
    if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
```

## Session Radix Cache

SGLang can tag ordinary evictable radix KV with the normalized agent session ID without pinning requests to a worker or creating a separate streaming-session lifecycle.

> **Availability:** This currently requires installing SGLang from source. The necessary server arguments are not available in a released SGLang package yet. Without `--enable-session-radix-cache`, Dynamo leaves this path disabled.

Launch the worker with:

```bash
python -m dynamo.sglang \
  --model-path <model> \
  --enable-session-radix-cache \
  --radix-eviction-policy priority
```

Dynamo reads session identity from agent headers such as `X-Dynamo-Session-ID` and passes it to SGLang on every generate request. `X-Dynamo-Session-Final: true` is normalized into an internal KV eviction hint and forwarded with the agent context, but the SGLang backend does not act on that hint in this release.

The radix entries remain normally evictable. Sending `X-Dynamo-Session-ID` does not enable sticky sessions, and `--enable-session-radix-cache` does not create router affinity. Configure any session-aware routing policy separately.

## Quickstart

The `agg_agent.sh` launcher starts an aggregated SGLang worker and Dynamo frontend for agent workloads:

```bash
bash examples/backends/sglang/launch/agg_agent.sh \
  --model-path zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash --tp 2
```

Agent providers send session headers directly; no body-level lifecycle object is needed.
