## 1. vLLM Backend

vLLM offers the broadest feature coverage in Dynamo, with full support for disaggregated serving, KV-aware routing, KV block management, LoRA adapters, and multimodal inference including video and audio.

> **Notes:**
> 1. **Multimodal + KV-Aware Routing**: Image-aware KV routing is supported in the documented vLLM paths. The default Rust frontend path supports model families handled by `llm-multimodal`; the Python chat-processor path delegates to vLLM's multimodal processor. ([Source][mm-kv-routing])
> 2. **KV-Aware LoRA Routing**: vLLM supports routing requests based on LoRA adapter affinity.
> 3. **Audio Support**: vLLM supports audio models like Qwen2-Audio (experimental). ([Source][mm-vllm])
> 4. **Video Support**: vLLM supports video input with frame sampling. ([Source][mm-vllm])
> 5. **Speculative Decoding**: Eagle3 support documented. ([Source][vllm-spec])

## 2. SGLang Backend

SGLang is optimized for high-throughput serving with fast primitives, providing robust support for disaggregated serving, KV-aware routing, and request migration.

| Feature | Disaggregated Serving | KV-Aware Routing | SLA-Based Planner | KV Block Manager | Multimodal | Request Migration | Request Cancellation | LoRA | Tool Calling | Speculative Decoding |

| **Tool Calling** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🚧 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | | — | |
| **Speculative Decoding** | 🚧 | 🚧 | — | 🚧 | — | 🚧 | — | | 🚧 | — |

> **Notes:**
> 1. **Multimodal + KV-Aware Routing**: Not supported. ([Source][kv-routing])
> 2. **Multimodal Patterns**: Supports simple Aggregated **EPD**, **E/PD**, and **E/P/D** patterns. Traditional Disagg **EP/D** is not supported. ([Source][mm-sglang])
> 3. **Request Cancellation**: Cancellation during the remote prefill phase is not supported in disaggregated mode. ([Source][sglang-readme])
> 4. **Speculative Decoding**: Code hooks exist (`spec_decode_stats` in publisher), but no examples or documentation yet.

## 3. TensorRT-LLM Backend

TensorRT-LLM delivers maximum inference performance and optimization, with full KVBM integration and robust disaggregated serving support.

| Feature | Disaggregated Serving | KV-Aware Routing | SLA-Based Planner | KV Block Manager | Multimodal | Request Migration | Request Cancellation | LoRA | Tool Calling | Speculative Decoding |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

| **Speculative Decoding** | ✅ | ✅ | — | ✅ | — | ✅ | ✅ | | ✅ | — |

> **Notes:**
> 1. **Multimodal Disaggregation**: Supports **EP/D** (Traditional) and **E/P/D** (Full Disaggregation) image flows, including image URLs and pre-computed embeddings. ([Source][mm-trtllm])
> 2. **Multimodal + KV-Aware Routing**: Image-aware KV routing is supported through the dedicated TRT-LLM MM Router Worker. It requires KV event publishing on the TRT-LLM workers. ([Source][mm-kv-routing])
> 3. **Request Cancellation**: Due to known issues, the TensorRT-LLM engine is temporarily not notified of request cancellations, meaning allocated resources for cancelled requests are not freed.
